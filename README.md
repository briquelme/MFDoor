# proyect1
Small python program for access handling using a Raspberry Pi 3, MFRC522 reader and RFID tags.

## Current status
This project was written years ago in Python 2 originally. I haven't been able to test it with hardware, making it hard for me to rewrite the scripts to improve the code quality.


## Usage
I can't validate the required hardware for this project to work. Will add ASAP. In the meantime, don't use it.
